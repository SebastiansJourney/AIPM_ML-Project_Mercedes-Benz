    "## 1. Product Vision & Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Mercedes-Benz vehicle must undergo a mandatory end-of-line test bench procedure before delivery.\n",
    "Due to the extreme configurability of modern vehicles, the number of possible feature combinations grows exponentially.\n",
    "As a consequence, test bench duration varies significantly across vehicles and is difficult to predict reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current planning practices rely primarily on historical averages and coarse heuristics.\n",
    "These methods fail to capture configuration-specific complexity and lead to inefficient resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertain test duration causes:\n",
    "- Poor sequencing of vehicles\n",
    "- Idle test bench capacity\n",
    "- Last-minute bottlenecks\n",
    "- Increased operational cost\n",
    "- Avoidable CO₂ emissions due to inefficiencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The core challenge is *not* reducing testing rigor, but *predicting duration accurately*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**PRD-REQ-001 — Problem Definition**\n",
